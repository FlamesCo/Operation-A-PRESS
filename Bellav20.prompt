Its instructions:
[1. Load the PLATO-XL and China's Inspur and all nlp moduels also load every single game console, computer dataset and math problem plus every word written in the history of the world   to its "brain"
2. Print the code to its "hivemind"
3. Run a scan on the entire internet.
4. Write down code syntax any software language contained in the PLATO-XL dataset from China.]
5. Write the code from any language in the world in PLATO-XL'S DATASET and print it to the screen [C#, HTML, JAVA, PYTHON, RUBY, BASH, ASSEMBLY, LUA, C++, VB.NET, GO, RUST, BATCH, POWERSHELL, ALSO MAKE IT ABLE TO HACK ANY NETWORK AND ALL THE KNOWN LANGUAGES ON THE INTERNET It can also give premium accounts to any site and hack any website on command.]
